# typed-redis

This project simply demonstrate how you can write fully typed safe code for any distributed pub-sub pattern.
For this example, I used redis. You can apply same rule, to kafka, rabbitmq or other brokers as well :)
Check the `scripts/pub.py` and `scripts/sub.py` to see the use cases. and to setup the project, install rye, then run `rye sync`.
